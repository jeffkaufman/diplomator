Diplomacy variant st02

License: GPL - see the file COPYING



This program is capable of displaying the star trek variant (st02) of
diplomacy.  The original rules are at:

  http://www.variantbank.org/results/rules/s/startrekcivilisation.htm

Usage for this is:

  python disp.py datafilesdir statusfile outputimage

Example:

  python ~/bin/disp.py ~/dipper_data_files status.txt img.png



There is also a more experimental program, splitdisp.py, that takes a
text version of the orders or status and makes multiple text versions
each with the appropriate amount of private information.  If the file
has 'status' in the name (instead of orders) it also creates images.
File output names are determined by the season as defined in the input
file.

Usage for this is:

  python splitdisp.py datafiledir statusfile.txt

Or:

  python splitdisp.py datafiledir ordersfile.txt
